# Project 17 – PHP Student Marks Table (Associative and Multidimensional Arrays)

This project demonstrates how to manage and display structured data using **Associative Arrays** and **Multidimensional Arrays** in PHP.  
Student names and their subject marks are dynamically displayed using nested loops.
