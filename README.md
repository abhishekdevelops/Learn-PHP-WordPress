## üöÄ Why This Repo Exists

Even though I had already built WordPress websites before, I decided to deepen my backend development skills to become a full-fledged WordPress Developer ‚Äî capable of building custom themes, plugins, and dynamic solutions entirely from scratch without relying on page builders.

This repository serves as my **public learning journal**, **technical portfolio**, and **motivation tracker**.
