# Project 27 â€“ SQL Sorting Users

This project demonstrates how to sort users dynamically based on different columns such as Name, Age, or Email using PHP and SQL ORDER BY. A simple and clean HTML table is displayed showing users sorted according to the selected column. Dynamic links allow users to choose which field to sort by, and the backend uses secure SQL ORDER BY queries to handle the sorting based on user selection while preventing invalid inputs.

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Dynamic Sorting Links | Allow users to sort the user list by Name, Age, or Email |
| SQL ORDER BY Query | Sort user data directly in MySQL |
| Security Handling | Prevent invalid sort columns from being passed |
| Simple User Table Display | Display sorted users in a clean HTML table |

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `sort_users.php` | Full logic to sort users dynamically based on selected column |

To test this project, start the XAMPP Apache and MySQL servers. Place the project folder inside `C:\xampp\htdocs\27-sql-sorting-users\` and then open your browser and visit `http://localhost/27-sql-sorting-users/sort_users.php`. You will see a user list where you can click on Name, Age, or Email links to dynamically sort the users based on the selected column.

What I learned in this project:
- How to build dynamic SQL queries using ORDER BY
- How to handle user-selected sorting parameters securely
- How to display sorted data neatly in PHP
- How to prevent SQL injection by validating sorting parameters
