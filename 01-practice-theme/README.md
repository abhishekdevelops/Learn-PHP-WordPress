# 📁 01-practice-theme – PHP Basics Practice (Syntax, Variables, Echo/Print, Comments)

This folder contains my very first PHP practice project, where I explored the **core basics of PHP** — all within a simple WordPress theme structure.

---

## 🔰 Topics Practiced:
- **PHP Syntax** – Using opening `<?php` and closing `?>` tags
- **Variables** – Declaring and using `$variables`
- **Output** – Using `echo` and `print` to display text
- **Comments** – Writing:
  - `//` single-line comments
  - `/* */` multi-line comments
- **HTML + PHP Integration** – Mixing PHP inside HTML

---

## 🚀 Why WordPress?
Since I'm becoming a WordPress developer, I practiced these PHP basics **inside a WordPress theme folder** to see how PHP logic fits in a real-world environment.

---

## 📁 Files:
- `index.php` – Practiced all PHP basics (syntax, variables, comments, echo/print)
- `style.css` – WordPress theme stylesheet with proper theme header to activate

---

## 💡 Goal:
To build a solid foundation in PHP by working hands-on with variables, output, and comments — all while simulating a real WordPress theme environment.
