This project demonstrates the use of functions in PHP to calculate student grades and return feedback messages.

## ✅ What It Does

- Uses a function `calculateGrade()` to determine grade from percentage
- Uses a function `getFeedback()` to return feedback based on the grade
- Outputs all results cleanly

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Function definition and calling
- Returning values from functions
- Passing parameters
- Switch-case logic
- Output formatting

├── index.php
└── README.md
```

## 🔄 How to Run
