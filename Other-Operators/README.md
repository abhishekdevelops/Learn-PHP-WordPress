# PHP Operators Practice – Marks Evaluation System

This project demonstrates the use of assignment, comparison, and logical operators in PHP using a simple marks evaluation system.

## 🧠 What It Does

- Accepts marks for three subjects
- Calculates total and percentage
- Checks if the student has passed all subjects (minimum 40 marks each)
- Assigns a grade based on percentage

## ✅ PHP Concepts Used

- Assignment operators: `=`
- Comparison operators: `>=`, `<`
- Logical operators: `&&`
- Conditional statements: `if`, `elseif`, `else`

## 📄 Sample Output

```
Total Marks: 240  
Percentage: 80%

```
